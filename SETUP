SETUP ON ANDROID DEVICES
Currently, Broadcast isn't available as a standalone APK, so you'll have to install it manually:

- Install Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) on the device: http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/
- Install the jruby interpreter on SL4A (can be found under "Interpreters")
- Copy the contents of this application directly to the SL4A script directory.  
  As of SL4A_r0, this is directory is /sdcard/sl4a/scripts.  Be sure 
  to copy this directly to the script directory, not a subdirectory!


DEVELOPMENT SETUP
In development mode, Broadcast has no external dependencies, other than Ruby!

Tested with the following:
ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174)
ruby 1.9.1p243 (2009-07-16 revision 24175)
jruby 1.2.0 (ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 287)


RUN THE APPLICATION
On a live Android device, simply run config.rb from SL4A.

In development mode, run config.rb using your favorite Ruby interpreter.

Note that the file is named config.rb, not the standard config.ru.  
Traditionally-named rackup files caused older versions of SL4A to crash.


RUN THE TESTS
On a live Android device, simply run config.rb from SL4A.

In development mode, run config.rb using your favorite Ruby interpreter.
